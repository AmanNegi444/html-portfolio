<h3> DARK KNIGHT</h3>
<P><IMG SRC="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Rmmv3o_tp2CjI3SL6eH3YgHaFj&pid=Api" alt="Heath Ledger as Joker" width="200">
    "</P>
<P>Its one of the best movie i have ever seen.</P>
<p>In this movie the joker and the batman both are like the two faces of a coin but one chose to be a villain and one to be a silent guardian</P>

<h3>THE DARK KNIGHT RISES</h3>
<P><IMG SRC="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.PbmCmj3DJcCXUcGvPlDhrwHaFj&pid=Api" alt="Christian Bale as Batman" width="200">
    "</P>
<p>Its the sequel of "THE DARK KNIGHT"</p>
<p>In this movie the batman had to faces multiplt challenges to protect his city</p>

<h3>THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN</h3>
<P><IMG SRC="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M0byI2P_8gVjJSCLtqeprgHaLH&pid=Api" alt="Amazing Spider-Man Poster" width="150">
 "</P>
<p>I found this movie good because in this movie peter parker got the powers of a spider,he can use those powers for fun and revenge. But he chose the path to help others with his powers </p>
<P>Because he believed that "great powers comes with great resposibility"</P>
